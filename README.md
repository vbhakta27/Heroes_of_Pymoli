# Heroes of Pymoli

After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. We have been given a csv file containing purchasing data located in the Resources folder.

## Conclusions
1) Most of the total revenue was generated by males and people in age group 20-24. Males spent the least amount per purchase but still generated the greatest total volume due to the sheer amount purhcase.
2) Percentage breakdown of total revenue by gender is closely proportional to the percentage amount of purchases by each gender and count of gender (i.e. male total revenue $1967.64/ total revenue $2,379.77 = 82.7% ~ percent of male players 84.0% ~ male purchase count 652/ total purchase count 780 = 80.1% )
3) The most popular items generate the the most revenue and are actually above the average price  ($3.06) for a game item. Kind of intuitive if prices are similar for the items but if the most popular items were priced very low then they might not generate the highest revenues. This shows they are priced well and can maybe even be increased on price because people are buying a lot of the items at the current high prices.
